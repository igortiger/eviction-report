# Load in your data
evictions <- read.csv("data/Eviction_Notices.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

# Compute some values of interest and store them in variables for the report

# How many evictions were there?

# Create a table (data frame) of evictions by zip code (sort descending)

# Create a plot of the number of evictions each month in the dataset

# Store plot in a variable

# Map evictions in 2017 

# Format the lat/long variables, filter to 2017

# Create a maptile background

# Add a layer of points on top of the map tiles
